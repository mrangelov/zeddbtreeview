TZedDBTreeView is Data Aware TreeView. It is designed to load self-referenced hierarchical data sets. It is fast and loads all the data when it is built. There's no need to rebuild the tree for every modification. Data's nature independent, so you can connect it to database on your choice. Supports browsing and modifications both ways (Tree -> Dataset, Dataset -> Tree).
